Trying to work in TDD workflow

## Machine

* [x] Finalize (or partially finalize) operations execution (end-to-end execution of some commands)
* [x] `in`/`out` commands implementation
* [ ] Hermetization cleanup
* [ ] Stack register
* [ ] Properly handling PC updating (check jumps)
* [ ] Execute program from std input
* [ ] Memory handling
* [ ] Proper error handling (thiserror/anyhow)

## Some theory

* [x] Generics
* [ ] Ownership + borrowing model
* [x] Lifetimes
* [ ] Memory model

## Maybe

* [ ] Threading basics
